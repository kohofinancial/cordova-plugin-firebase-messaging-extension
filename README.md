# cordova-plugin-firebase-messaging-extension
This plugin solves the problem for a Cordova application that has multiple FCM push providers.  In KOHO's case specifically, this plugin extends a Firebase messaging service for routing tokens and messages to Urban Airship and Intercom.  It can be easily modified to provide the same service for other push providers.
